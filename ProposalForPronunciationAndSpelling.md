# Noop #

While the project header defines the pronunciation as "no-op" (like the machine instruction), several project contributors affectionally call it "noop" (rhymes with soup).  I propose that this be permitted as an official, alternate pronunciation.  Mostly this is my revenge on all the americans forcing me to say "jahva" instead of "jaava", which sounds decidedly less pretentious to my Canadian ears.

# NººP #

While we're on the subject, I propose that the official spelling be capital-N, degree-glyph, degree-glyph, capital P.  Mostly to be pretentious.
